    "Really interesting. Looking at the results, there are a few cases of mis-classifications:\n",
    "- Reviews that are not in English. Presumably reviews not in English won't be as robust in terms of tokenization and vectorization. (Note: fixed now, but no obvious improvement in performance.)\n",
    "- Reviews that contain negation expressions, eg \"no good\" is classified as a positive review when in reality it should be negative. BoW approach makes it hard for ML model to recognize this kind of expressions.\n",
    "- Reviews that are mis-classified due to rating. Eg a customer may write something negative but give 3 stars. It's tricky in this case because it's a caveat of our dataset.\n",
    "- Some mis-classification is the ML model being weirdly off, eg ComplementNB classified a \"Good\" review as negative, or reviews containing the word 'hate' gets classified as positive.\n",
    "- Contextual awareness is important and this is something that bag-of-word approaches cannot address. For example the sentence 'Very good. Expensive delivery charge though' gets classified as negative likely because of the word expensive, while in reality this is a positive review."
