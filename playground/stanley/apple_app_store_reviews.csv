2. The distance between my address and passenger address is measured by straight line. Please, I am driving airplane, I need judge base on the actual extra time consuming for the passenger. So either you provide the actual route distance or extra time I need to spent for the trip. It’s will be much easier for driver to make decisions 
3. Can you provide the setting for driver to set the range for above 2 information? I really don’t want to receive more than 50 passengers information but actually no one suitable for me. 
4. Can you allow driver to send message before taking the trip? Sometimes we want to negotiate the starting time with passengers. If passengers agree to start early or late by 10mins, I may take the hitch request otherwise I will skip. Else you can add in option for passengers whether they are flexible on the time.

They just blame it to the system for auto cancelling the order, and repetitively said “please reorder from the restaurant, if the restaurant no longer avail (which they don’t) just find other options, nothing we can help”.

When it comes to EVERY DELIVERY across the island grabfood is always 30-40 even 1.5 hours late sometimes during peak hour. How do you justify that? Firstly it’s dishonest to state delivery will be 35 minutes when it really delayed till 1.5 hours. Best part is when I reported it the refund was $3. $3 for wasting 1.5 hours of my time. As the largest food deliverer in the industry I don’t understand how this is fair. Grab has become extremely stingy now that it is basically consuming all of its competitors; charging exorbitant prices with no promotions like they used to just because they can. 

2. Whenever I order cold food it always comes melted. Today I ordered ice cream and the deliverer that was allocated was given multiple orders to deliver as stated by the app. And furthermore he was on a bicycle. This is cruel. With all the money grab has can’t they also ensure their drivers are given decent equipment. Or at least ensure that the drivers have adequate vehicles to provide the best service?

To add insult to injury, cancellation incurs a cancellation fee even though it is Grab’s poor routing algorithm that adds another 15 minutes to waiting time.

Grab should allow free cancellation when the assigned driver has to drop another passenger off.

My elderly neighbour left his bag (containing all his valuables and MOBILE PHONE) in a Grab car and couldn’t get back into his house. Distressed, he knocked on our door for help, and fortunately, my husband and I were working from home and able to help him. There is absolutely NO hotline, NO phone numbers AT ALL for us to contact Grab Singapore. All help resources point us to contact the Grab driver THROUGH the mobile phone from which it is booked. However, my neighbour’s mobile phone is INSIDE his bag INSIDE the vehicle and he is obviously unable to contact the driver without it. We used some online form to report the loss (which asked for booking ID, which we don’t have the mobile phone) and received an automatic reply saying someone would contact us about this issue within 24 hours. Now, our neighbour was stranded outside his house without his keys, so we invited him into our house to wait. We all agreed it was too much to have to wait 24 hours for someone from Grab to get back to us. My husband and I frantically scoured the Grab website, app, and social media platforms, desperately trying to find a number, any number, leading to an actual human being to guide us. We thought of going to the police station with our neighbour to make a report, but before that, we tried just calling my neighbour’s mobile phone to see if by any chance the driver might notice. LUCKILY, the driver did notice, and was so kind to pick up the phone. He had realised what had happened and resolved to drive back to where he had dropped off my neighbour so that my neighbour can get his belongings back. If it was not for the driver’s individual kindness and compassion, we would not have had ANY means of communicating in a timely fashion with Grab Singapore to try to get my neighbour’s belongings back. Now, our neighbour is elderly and not au fait with technology at all. Without our help, he would never have been able to navigate things like online forms, or live help chats (even this, for that matter, we couldn’t find it anywhere). He lives alone, and if we were not home, he surely would not have been able to easily resolve this. We neglected to get the kind driver’s name as our neighbour was very distressed and just wanted to quickly get home to rest. However we remembered that his vehicle number was 8951. A huge THANK YOU to this driver with a heart of gold. We are eternally grateful for your kindness and service excellence. If not for your timely action, our elderly neighbour would have suffered a lot more. Thank you very much.

And as a customer, I have a curious journey to share, and along the way, some notes to make grab more usable. I ordered food from a restaurant at around 5, the app gleefully indicate delivery time at be 5.40 (no chance, we both know this, so perhaps you can calculate a reasonable time so people can plan around it instead of having nice numbers to show?). I opened the app again at around 6 and lo and behold, estimated time is now 6.30. Opened again, 6.40. Perhaps it is  not obvious to you (I think it should be), people have to plan around ordering in, and food for the whole family is not something you can just magically create when your app just bail on you. The order is cancelled shortly afterwards. But hey, you can call to ask for help. Just like a great drama, of course the calling doesn’t work. You are given a pin, which upon entering, you are told ‘wrong pin’ (Actual technical issue #1). On the third try it worked. Operator on the phone said sorry, it should have notified half an hour after noone agree to take the delivery (so at 5.30? nothing till 6+, Actual technical issue #2). So now that we established the grab system is at fault for not notifying, is there any actions? Of course not, a restaurant might give you a free soup for bungling your order but not Grab, why? (I’m too good I don’t actually have to be good issue #1). 
You can see this as a rambling customer, or you can see this for what is it, it is up to you. How to fix this? Better testing of your one and only app (at least from customer point of view).

Some driver think it should be on the ground floor but some will got to basement. 
I just came across this last week. I was already waiting at the pick up point when I made the booking. After 10mins the App sent message that the driver has arrived the destination but I did not see any. As a frequent user I guessed he might have went to basement carpark. Hense I immediately called him to clarify my location as to avoid the late charge which will implies to me. The line signal was poor. So I sent text for clear communication saying that please come to ground floor as I am waiting here. He then called me again and spoke with very rude and bad tantrums blaming me that I should waited at carpark bla bla bla. I started worry on my safety as the voice tone is kind of scary. Am I still safe to take this ride? I have no idea how good or bad will this drive behave since he has such a rude manner. Immediately after he cut off the line, the booking being cancelled by him. My App also being suspended as I request to cancel the waiting fee implied to me. Because of this incident I was late to my important appointment and some loss occurred. This really a bad experience and I am scared to use Grab ride anymore as I am u certain how bad or good is the next driver.

He tried to find a number to call them to let them know but could not find one. So he sent a message but did not get a reply.

When I came home later, I found that the Grab app had used “use my current location” for his address. Although this had the right condo name it had the wrong block number and no unit number. So it was incomplete and there was no way the delivery person could have delivered the food.

When I contacted Grab to report again that my son had not received his food and find out why no one had called or sent a message to clarify his address, the response I got was very poor. They said the delivery person confirmed he was unable to deliver the food as the address was inaccurate. They said he waited for 5 mins, (at an address he knew was wrong), left, and that the food was then destroyed. He went onto say Grab would not be providing a refund as it was our responsibility to make sure our address was correct.

While I agree my son should have taken more care to ensure his address was correct, I cannot see why if the address is obviously not complete that someone from Grab, either when the order is taken or when the food is getting delivered, cannot call or send a message for a clarification, They have my son’s phone number so a quick call while waiting at the adjacent block could have resolved the issue.

So i cancel my order and the services fee increase to $5.80, and then I immediately got a driver. So many times such issue occurred, the food is not very far from where I stay, I have some work to attend to therefore use delivery food. However the service fee is charged $6.00 and above when it's just walking distance from my house to the shopping mall? Seriously? And I have to wait for so long to get my food assign? How is my service fee worth it then.

UPDATE: My house to the mall is just 1.1KM. Experience higher fee during peak hours? Then why are you still charging us such high service fee when you can't get any driver for such a long period of waiting time (I saw other reviews facing same problem.) Apart from that, your in-app helpline did not provide any form of help, there is no one that can assist us unless we can find our question in the FAQ or call you directly (which majority of the time did not assist the problem or answer call due to Covid.) 

Foodpanda in the other hand, do not charge such high unreasonable service fee, have driver within 10mins, NO PEAK HOUR extra charges OR WHATSOEVER on service fee, PROVIDES A PERSON THAT CAN ASSIST YOUR PROBLEM INSTANTLY IN APP, give you a coupon for their slightest mistake. 

Other than your grab ride service, your grabfood services really is very expensive and need more improvement for loyal customers. 

You have a wider selection of more than 7,000 restaurants compared to Foodpanda, yet you are not able to assist problems instantly, give your loyal customer any coupon for your mistake. From all of the above, customers still choose you because we're loyal customers that have grabpay etc with you. So please do take our advice and improve on your service, there are lots of complaints on Grabfood services.
 
And my friend worked for your Grabfood delivery, from what I heard, the job is great due to flexibility on time, but the pay is lesser than Foodpanda's, waiting for order to be assign is also hard!

Being the dominant in this industry, Grab does not prioritise customer’s experience and satisfaction AT ALL. 

I had issues with my grab pay wallet refund, called in for help, they blamed it on the merchant and asked me to liaise with them. Merchant explained and even proved to me (invoice) that refund has been made. 

Asked grab for help again, customer service was reluctant to help, but I had to coach her one by one and then she realised there is a discrepancy in one of the transaction. Only now the case is being investigated. Totally wasted my time from the beginning!! On top of that, I had to ask for the follow up regarding this issue, and be the one to call in for a follow up!??

Lucky I spotted the refund not going through, imagine what happens if I don’t! My $50 will be just burnt like that? And I still have not gotten my refund to date. It’s been 3 weeks now and the team is still “investigating”. 

It now seems like I’m a loanshark asking for money. Spent too much time and energy on this issue. The lack of care, haste and urgency is DISGUSTING and FRUSTRATING. 

Why do the customers have to be the one suffering from your “investigation!!”

Just because it isn’t your money or your problem doesn’t mean you shouldn’t care. 

Remember that even though you’re the leading one in this industry right now, if you don’t improve your customer service standards, you won’t be able to go far or survive. 

Service is very important, look at how all the successful brands over the years... they take their customers seriously and that’s why they are where they are now.

Three major unpleasant problem with these guys. 

1) Double booking. Grab hides whether the driver or rider is double booking - meaning they will finish another job before doing mine. This is not intelligently done. I saw a driver go way out of my path then come back. Very problematic when in a rush for a ride. Frustrating when my food arrives in 1:30hrs all cold and uneatable.

2) Now the bigger problem is the moment you find out it is double booking and you wish to cancel - either cause you’re in a hurry or you wish to eat your food hot : you simply can’t. You can cancel your ride but repeatedly doing so - they just suspend your account. What am I supposed to do and I have no choice but to be late to my meeting? Is it so wrong to try to book a ride, and finding the ride is gonna be late as it’s a double booking, so I cancel and look for another ride : is this so wrong??!

3) Now here is why I try best not to use Grab if possible. As said my account got suspended, my mileages are all unusable. You can’t do without Grab here (in desperate need of a competitor) so had to subscribe using another phone number. Anyways, problem is when they suspend there is no pre notice or warning. You have to read through the user contracts and strictly abide by the rules yourself because these guys have no tolerance on violation. If you do something wrong - like cancelling a double booking ride since you’re in a hurry - then you get suspended.

Now here is the best one. Once you’re suspended then you’re literally out. No way to contact customer service as the link they provide to make a claim is invalid URL.

I can’t even believe a company with this mentality can even survive in this modern tech world. Let’s see where you get to. Evil companies don’t survive. I try my best to use alternatives and will recommend all others to do so. You have my word.",1,Grab is going very wrong,dav0821,GrabFood

Here’s what I encounter:
After switching to my new phone, I was unable to log in to my existing grab account. Searched in the web and couldn’t find any customer service hotline to call. So I had to use the facebook messenger to reach out to Grab. The encounter with the Grab personnel (Lincoln) over the measenger is so unpleasant. He is basically bringing me in circle and casually giving suggestion without conducting thorough analysis on what’s going on with my account. At first he told me that the email I provided lead to a fresh account. When I probe further as all his suggestion did not resolve my login issue than he said my email is linked to another phone number which is different from what I provided. I asked him what is the number as I am concerned whether someone hacked my email account since I do not have a second hp no. But he just did not provide any answer for this. 
Since he was unable to resolve it for me. Several time I requested for him to provide me other ways to reach out such as getting someone more senior to attend to my case or provide me with other channel to leverage the issue. All of this is left unanswered (Basically he just selective answer the question and bring me in circle without resolving the issue). Or perhaps Grab although being a big company really do not have other customer service channel. Oh well.... 

Fustrated I even said that I might considered reporting it to CASE Singapore since it seem like there is a unauthorized hp no. Linked to my email account. But he just simply not response at all after. 

I have deleted the Grab app from my phone. Being complacent will only cause you to go downhill. Good luck Grab.",1,Couldn’t access my grab account,Zionleo,GrabFood

However, one thing I would have appreciated is to have gotten more reminders about the change in your food subscription plan. When you decided to change it from 7.99 to 9.99, and add minimum order of $10 to use the free delivery fee, you only sent out one mass in-app notification to all customers affected. However, I happen to be that one user who did not receive that in-app notification despite checking my inbox regularly. Maybe I could have deleted the notification accidentally which could be my fault or the notification could have been flooded with other notifications I have cause I constantly use Grab. It was a highly unpleasant feeling to realize your subscription plan was affected without even knowing the change. I would NOT have renew the plan if I know the change would have happen. And I cannot cancel the current subscription plan or get a refund even though I have not yet to use the vouchers? I understand the company has to ensure they are not making a lost so I understand the change.

Thanks.', 'modified': '2019-06-15T04:05:11Z'}","Grab’s decision to venture into the FNB industry was an excellent idea. I gave consumers a greater variety of food to choose from. However what I hope grab would improve on is that the menu should not change drastically. What I mean is that within 5 minutes, the list of restaurants drop from 20+ to a mere 5 restaurants. I get that the number of restaurants depends on the number of riders, but grab should not remove the restaurants entirely. It’s super confusing as I do not know which food app I saw the restaurant from. Instead of removing the restaurant entirely from the list, instead show that’s it’s offline or temporarily closed so that at least consumers know that grab provide services for this particular restaurant and we can keep an eye on it. Also, just a few minutes ago, I saw wingstop on the list of food, but the moment I came back to the page after checking for my grab rewards, the restaurant just disappeared entirely. It’s not even ‘closed’ or something like that. 
One more thing that grab can improve on is in the option is allowing us to make remarks on our food. Some dishes (usually the wet dishes) are best delivered with the soup/gravy separated to prevent soggy-ness, and some could be allergy or simply do not one a particular ingredient in their food. So perhaps, adding an extra remark function would solve the above issue. Thank you",4,Grabfood,Kuruk,GrabFood

Estimated time of arrival for the Grab cars is inaccurate, e.g. a 5 min wait ends up being a 12 min wait. Afew times drivers would cancel on me because they know my destination- a feature Uber would not allow. There should be a limitation on the app of hours driven by a Grab driver per day, there has been situations where there has been shared experiences amongst peers of drivers looking exhausted and sleeping on the wheel- my friend had an accident last week due to this situation. The scoring system on Grab for passengers and drivers compared to Uber needs to be followed through thoroughly. I don’t get the impression that Grab is taking customer feedback and acting on them (Uber acts on feedback immediately and not just with an automated message of acknowledgement)- I’ve been in smelly cars, untidy cars. In regards to Grab Food, would be fantastic to also have Grab food option for NO single use plastic cutlery!!! Another important feedback is DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR GRAB FOOD RIDERS. There has been countless times everyone has seen them gone through red lights to rush a delivery.

Initially I used to take grabtaxi as they have not introduced grabcar yet, and there were a lot of problems with the drivers, e.g. They said they were there but I just don't see them, ended up cancelled my booking, others just took their own sweet time to come, the app stated 7 mins but I waited for over 15 mins and still not here yet, driver called to say he was in a jam, but it was not a peak period and I do not see how there could be a jam, I've double checked as well. 10 mins later I still see him in the exact same location, not moving at all. It's either the time lag between real time and the system, if not it's just the driver lying. Even worse, another driver even shouted at me through the phone because I couldn't find his taxi at my location. I think they should be educated more, and I've written more than 3 complaint emails to grabtaxi for the past 6 months but till now, I didn't even get a single reply from them, and yet they can still emphasize that if we have any problems we could feedback to them. But what's the point of this policy of your company if you do not even reply the people who gave you feedback?

For example, ikea building taxi stand, bus stop, pick up point etc. in fact when we create route, it compute any passenger near that area, not passenger at that pin point location.

First, all my rides recently have seriously spoil my mood/day. 1. The driver was terribly late (Yes, I’ve waited for 20 minutes for my driver to arrive when he said he was coming in 6 minutes. Didn’t bother to pick up my calls or reply my messages.) 2. Drivers take extremely long routes (An average 6-10 minutes ride, took me almost half an hour. As soon as I realized he was taking a longer route, I gave him clear instructions but he refuses to listen to them and even missed my carpark!) 3. Drivers are extremely slow. Travelling at 40-60km on a normal road the whole journey is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. 4. Drivers do not inform when you’re sharing a ride with someone. They just pick up another passenger, and not even inform us who is going to be dropped off first. 5. Tried GrabFood, it was unsurprisingly disappointing. My food came late and in a mess. I appreciate that the driver called to apologize tho'. Lastly, stop hiking your fares when you fail miserably at giving satisfactory services. My family and I are going to boycott Grab until you rectify the abovementioned situations.

I have been actively using grab for the past few months ( reaching gold status ) & here’s the thing. 

While I do understand for grab drivers the more trips they take, the more incentives and pay they get, the grabshare system is very biased against customers like us. It is perfectly understandable that more trips = more incentives, however the distance between both locations can be improved.
 
I do often travel from the east to the west, however the trips I’ve shared with customers can prove to irritate other riders like me. A lot of these customers I share my rides with me have locations that’re not anywhere close to my desired location for example CBD district. I do get the concept of grabshare as it’s on the way, however my desired location and their location are simply too far off & it simply takes up a lot of time. 

I would recommend that the grabshare system should be implemented whereby both locations should not have a radius of more than 3-5km. This would ensure more positive rides for drivers and customers.

Of course, I would love to see the improvements made in the future & I’ll be there to witness a change for the better of all.

However I've noticed some drivers recently who accepted booking, and called back instructing me to cancel booking because they ""realized"" that I'm in CBD zone and ERP is active. I would generally reject them, saying that it's alright if they don't wish to pick me up, but they have to cancel their own booking since they are the defaulters. One particular driver didn't seem to take my suggestion very well and purposely left the booking engaged after ending my call. For 5 mins thereafter, I noticed that driver is still at the same spot and never moved -still not cancelling the ride, forcing me to end it if I wish to book another, which I did as I was ""forced"" to. 

GRAB has to discipline / give demerits to drivers like these. Otherwise, when more drivers become more arrogant like these - GRAB might go down the same path as Uber, losing huge pools of users because of their complacency. 

On the other hand, GRAB has definitely outperformed Uber in terms of their app stability and security, which uber horribly lacks. Grab's usage is generally seamless, and fuss-free. Please keep it up.",4,Mostly easy to use and good service,Wyyman15,GrabFood

While it seems like you are trying to make things more convenient for everyone by integrating everything into one main app, Im not sure if you have thought this out properly or are you trying to limit and push your users away. 

I frankly think it is ridiculous when you call it an integration when now you can only do ONE task at a time. And I found this out the hard way. I timed it and ordered food for my family before trying to get transport home. So imagine my horror when I realized I would have to wait 45 mins for my food to be delivered before I can get transport. Obviously I took an alternate mode of transport. And what happens if someone needs to make an advance food order. So they can’t get transportation till then? It is ridiculous isn’t it? And why curtail people’s freedom to make multiple orders?  I mean there are times people wanna order from different vendors. I hope these are just teething issues because the Grab experience right now is the total OPPOSITE of a thoughtful, integrated and efficient one. I hope you guys will rethink this.

On a positive note, there seems to be many more choices for Grabfood though I’ve not tried if they actually work. And the interface with the photos do look nicer than before. So keep that up :)",2,Disappointed. Integration?!?!,ru_L,GrabFood

Things you could do on the old app which made a huge difference to me that you can’t do on this new (annoying) app. 

1) order from multiple restaurants at the same time
2) order when you’re in the middle of a ride from the Grab car

3) they saved the items in you basket for you when you’re still deciding between restaurants so when you decide that you really want to purchase something from the first restaurant after all, you don’t have to start the whole order all over again. (Try doing this again for a Subway order. And holding your cool.) 

4) scheduled deliveries. Those were a godsend, I used to always have food delivered and waiting right when I get home. It’s an amazing feature and they took it away. How rude. 

5) I understand the need for privacy when it comes to revealing your unit number on a shared app. But back when the apps were separate I didn’t have to keep remembering to key in my unit number for Grab food drivers. BECAUSE THE APPS WERE SEPARATE.

I purposely chose the place to alight which is along the way of the trip. No detour and even not any left / right turn is required. In fact, it was about 800 meters away on a straight road from my home which is the destination of that trip. To my surprise that the driver charged me additional $5 under Tolls & others.

I thought the driver is kind enough and flexible enough to let me alight first but he did not mention anything about the surcharge when I requested for an early alight. He took it that the passenger will know. However, to my common sense that it does not incur any cost for the driver to let me alight first. Why are you charging me that $5?

1. I can’t update my destination in the app mid ride if I have to change location.  This results in lots of manual updating by the driver.

2. Driver adds various extras for ERP - this seems legit but surprised not done automatically by the app.

Below is based on my personal experiences on its entirety, without prejudice. 

I accidentally topped up money to my Grab Wallet via PayNow below their minimum threshold of ($10) which the said transaction failed. Informed GrabFood customer service and was told my money will be refunded back, which eventually is not the case. So if you ever top up the wrong amount, beware that you will never get this money of yours back. I have taken this case as donation to poor, scheming beggars.

Additionally, beware of ordering from Drinkies (Beer). Subject delivery personnel employed by Grab are uncivilized and uneducated that he actually put my ordered beers on the floor outside of my condo and claimed it was contactless delivery; to be crystal clear, contactless delivery only applies if I requested for it, which I did not in this case. The delivery personnel has absolute disregard for the hygiene of my ordered beers whatsoever by placing it on the floor without my consent.

$35 / 25 rides = $1.40 per ride ( you're already paid)

Recently, I took Grabshare 
*Metered Fare $8.50. 
*15% off       - $1.30 
Which means this trip I totally paid for $8.60 ???
No 15% discount, but you paid more instead. 

What about ”each capped at $4”?

5504,2017-11-24 00:53:39,False,,"Grab scheme is to get you hooked and invested once it does it wastes your time and money. Firstly not only is the GPS time inaccurate it leads Drivers to wrong locations even when other apps can easily find it with no issues showing a lack in adapting. A lot f Drivers acknowledge this problem but grab has since yet to done anything. Second is grabshare, while the concept is understandable the extent they allow Drivers to pick up another rider goes beyond limits from literally driving backwards and completely out of the way. To add on locations may not be close or even on the way to your location. Just Grab  supposedly to counter this by having only you as a passenger yet again grab has managed to ruin it allowing Drivers to accept your ride before they even drop off a current passenger. To make it worse the gps can say 10 min but by experience you can wait 30-40 min waiting for your driver an which you can’t cancel because they only give you two cancels before charging you. To conclude as a driver this app can be amazing, it allows you to secure many rides and make passengers wait because they know consumers have to pay. Further more many Drivers say the ride is complete before it is just for their convenience. As for the consumer once you get invested you will realise and get frustrated how much worse they make the app but as a competitor in today’s market it does not matter as grab will still profit from any choice they make.",2,The longer you use the worse it gets for consumers,otherrider,GrabFood

5757,2019-05-05 03:33:17,False,,"Recently Grab integrated their Grabfood app into their Grab app and I can say my experience as a Grabfood user is truly disappointing. 
First of all, ordering food thru the new app, we will need to key in everytime our unit no. The old Grabfood app used to allow us to set our default address in case for our next order but however the new Grabfood auto select the delivery address based on our location thru the GPS on our phone which I find it very tedious to have to check and change it when it's not correct.
Second of all, it used to be very quick and hassle free when you order your food thru the old Grabfood app. Now on the new Grabfood, when you placed an order, it has to search for a driver to deliver your food just like how you use it to call for a Grab ride. That doesn't end there, the waiting time for it to search for a driver to deliver your food was very long and it failed most of the time to search for an available driver as it always says it was unable to get a driver or all our driver are busy pls try order again. I doubt all your driver are busy. I also wonder what happens to the food the restaurant had already  prepared for the customer's order but end up there's no driver available to deliver. I think they must be in the same situation as they also can't get the order to their customers.
To sum it up, the new experience thru your new Grabfood is really disappointing and as a user who always order thru the Grabfood, the new app I can say it's not ready and you shouldn't fix what is not broken. Bring back the old app or fixed the new app before you rolled it out to your users don't try to be ambitious and greedy to implement new service or features that is not ready tested.",1,The new Grabfood is truly disappointing,budaejigae99,GrabFood

Today I was rushing for work and I got a driver who was 8mins away as he was dropping off a passenger. I messaged him “sorry im rushing :(“ to let him know I’m cancelling. 

I then booked another grab again to hopefully get a nearer driver... to which I got another driver who was 8mins away again. I got a notification “cancel less so in the future you’ll get nearer drivers!” 

I wish there’s somehow to improve these kind of situations. Like inputting “in a rush” options so drivers who are further away would be less likely to pick up the ride. Of course, I can see how that feature would be abused - or maybe limiting the amount of times you can use that option per month? Just a thought. Otherwise, this app is great.

Grabfood
The delivery fee for grabfood is high compared to the delivery fees in Foodpanda. The restaurant I wanted to order was 15mins away but the fee was $5, which I think it’s a bit pricey considering the distance. The deliverers are great - but the restaurants are always on and off... As in, the first time I order, they were available with no hassle... Now, subsequently, on many occasions the restaurants I pick are always unavailable to order or “temporarily closed” when like 30mins ago they were open. This happens regularly which I think it will help if it states closed from “ “ if it happens consistently, or providing that they are available to order only from this timing to that timing.

5955,2019-10-09 23:35:23,False,,"After the last big update, the loading time on scheduled and hitch rides page has increased to up to 20 secs, when it used to be almost completely fluid. On top of that, they have stopped notifying me whenever a hitch driver cancels the trip. Notifications on successful matching for hitch drivers are also inconsistent. Sometimes I get the notification, sometimes it’s completely silent. Due to this, I have to keep checking the scheduled trips page, which now takes 20 secs to load. And there’s a good chance the app will crash in the middle of this loading time. This is a complete step back in your service quality.

Also, estimated travel times for grabshare rides are completely misleading. Numerous times the estimated travel time says I would reach my destination in between 30-45mins. But almost every single time it takes me 1 hour or more to reach my destination. To add on, after successfully matching a driver for my grabshare, the app did not indicate that i will be sharing the ride, leading me to believe that I will be the only rider. As I needed to be on time for my national service reservist training, being the only rider was crucial as I could not afford to have a separate stop with another rider. It was solely because I was the only rider that I accepted the grabshare ride. The only reason I had to grabshare was because I wasn’t notified my hitch driver cancelled, and it was too late to try to find another hitch driver. When I boarded the ride, the driver carried on to pick up a second rider, with a drop off point that was completely out of the way of my destination, and adding in to that, traffic did not help the travelling time. In all, I arrived at my destination more than 40mins of the stipulated arrival timing displayed by the app, and I was late for my training. This is absolutely atrocious.

6104,2017-06-30 00:53:46,False,,"I am getting increasingly frustrated with Grab. Their ride assignment system is plain stupid. They assign drivers based on distance from rider as the crow flies. So most likely you are going to get a cab when it is wizzing past you, usually on it way to drop someone 5-10 mins away from you and then will take another 5-10 mins to find its way back to you. This of course frustrates the riders but also frustrates the drivers. They don't care about how long you will have to wait. And oh to make sure you are unable to make any issues with it - they won't allow you to cancel the ride (will charge $5 if you do) and there is NO way on their app to provide feedback about Grab itself. The only way I or the driver can share their feedback and by now frustration is by rating your last driver or passenger low. It's not the drivers fault - why should I rate them low? It's grab's stupidity and lack of understanding of how roads work. I have spoken with so many Grab drivers and they are all frustrated too. They are the ones who have to face irate passengers who had to wait 10-20 mins to get their cab and could not make other arrangements during the wait. Pathetic! Sadly - Uber is not a lot better on many of these counts. While these ride sharing apps have made life better in some ways - it shows how much they can manipulate and control our lives too. I hope neither of them win this crazy war they are fighting to kill the other off. There is enough for both and more.

First of all, I booked Grab taxi from The Peak, Blk 138C. I received a text message that it will arrive within a specific time to where I am located. Apparently Grab taxi did not arrive and the driver told me that he was waiting at Blk 138C. I highlight to him that I am waiting in block 138C but cannot see his car. So I went searching around other Blocks in case he made a mistake. True enough I noticed that he was waiting at block 139 and I wave to the driver to come over to block 138C. When he arrive to Blk 138C, he was shouting at me that he waited for me at Blk 138C. I told him he was waiting at Blk 139 and he claimed that he was waiting for 20 minutes. I explained to him that he was waiting at the wrong block number and does not want to listen to me. He was shouting at me and claiming more taxi fares because of the 20 minutes he waited. Besides, his car’s safety belt is not working and I told him that if the traffic police arrest his car, I am not going to pay the fine. How can Grab management allow such unsafe vehicle to be operating. Is Grab management is not concern of the safety of passenger in the Grab taxi. Anyway, the fare was $7 and he claimed $10 from me for his mistake he made. This is really ridiculous and Grab’s standard is really really dropping like hell.

But when I did that I was logged out and suspended immediately, it’s been such a long time since I see such speeds in action. But anyway I later found out I “may not have followed Grab’s terms and conditions.” (What even Grab? Are you cereal? Nice.) So as any normal human would do, I went and seek out assistance from Grab’s help centre by writing this appeal form (what the hell? Am I appealing for a seat in NUS or what. Dafug.) and (took 7 days before they got back to me) what the “helpful” lady advised me to do was to refresh my cache, and try and re-downloading the app she then asked me questions like how many grab points I have, which in my opinion was absolutely redundant and silly. How am I suppose to answer questions like this when I cannot even login right? I don’t take the effort to remember my grab points religiously and I believe I’m not the only one lol. (Indeed hilarious) so now (Day 12) the customer service person just emailed me and told me to re-submit the appeal form AGAIN. (Champion much?) by copying and pasting the whole t&c from the appeal form and emailed it to me. I wonder how a international company like Grab have such an inefficient and troublesome system.

Thus far I have encountered a 3 party Grabshare twice, both of which gave me awful experiences, especially if you are the second passenger being picked up. Two detours (one to drop off the first passenger and another to pick up the third passenger) severely increases travel time. The other case was when I was the first passenger on board and the driver picked up two other boarding passengers before dropping me off, each a party of one. This is basically incentivising those individuals to lie and say they’re a part of two when booking a grabshare. I was late to work despite leaving 15 minutes early in addition to travel time whenever I book a grabshare (it wasn’t even peak hours). 
Here’s an idea, either limit to 2 parties, or compensate a party if there’re 2 or more stops between boarding and alighting. 

2. Messy Interface *updated review*
YOUR 👏🏼 APP 👏🏼 IS 👏🏼 SO 👏🏼 SLOW 👏🏼
Ah yes, nothing says listening to customers feedback more than completely going in the reverse direction to provided feedback on UX/UI. I’m sure I’m not the only one who has raised such suggestions to split the different services into different apps. 
Pleas consider having individual apps for individual services - detach the grabfood and grabshuttle (Etc) buttons from the grab app itself. An app intended for transportation should not be clouded with unrelated services. Also, I would suggest having a Grabpay app by itself, where all the exclusive grab pay promotions can go to instead of appearing in grab notifications. Moreover, the games are really irrelevant to the app. Excessively crowding the transport app not only drains battery but also makes the user interface extremely slow. 

3. Map feedback
The pick up and drop off locations are exact. However, within campus, a couple of roads are blocked off and drivers cannot reach the pick up point if they take those entrances. These are not reflected in the map. I would suggest a feature that allows users to state which roads are blocked off so that drivers no longer need to make detours and uturns to find another way to reach the pick up point. 

4. Grab Points
I use grab a lot. Perhaps grab can allow users to earn points through the membership subscriptions to reward frequent users. I understand that the subscriptions already offer a good discount, maybe it can offer 2x grabpoints instead of the 3x grabpoints for rides when paid using GrabPay. 

The good part of grab is that so far all the rides I got have great and friendly drivers who are mostly on time.",2,Overcrowding in grabshare and Messy Interface,404waldonotfound,GrabFood

6643,2019-05-12 15:17:55,False,,"I ordered three cups of bubble tea from ShareTea and they arrived timely ...... but with no straws. I mean, how do you drink bubble tea without straws ?? Put it in a bowl and scoop the pearls one by one with a spoon ? 

What happen next was worst, I reflected this to grab by email as apparently their hotline is down. I got a reply in roughly 30 mins which by then my bubble tea have turned from iced green tea to diluted warm tea. Not sure what to do, I was hoping the email by them would help, but what I received was just a copy and paste template of a apology or rather I would do better email with the same hotline that was not available. If hotline is unavailable, cannot just take it out from the template ??? 

To make matters worst, their reply thru email was so slow I went to contact them thru Facebook messenger. After explaining my situation, they offered me a $5 voucher. So I paid $10.5, have to throw away as I do not know how they want me to drink, sent few hours of my time trying to contact grab, in the end got back a $5 voucher (so the remaining $5.50 just have to blame myself unlucky for using grab to order food....) FYI they said they are going to give me the $5 voucher since yesterday but did not get back from them after that. 

So story learn, If you want your $10+ bucks to disappear into thin air, gladly use grab food and face their annoyingly slow replies that gives no solution but just a apology that do not help the situation at all. Would normally be too lazy to even type 50 words but it was just a bad experience that spoilt my whole day that I just have to share it here. Looking at their customer help service, I doubt they are even reading this.

6687,2018-04-10 01:13:45,False,,"App UX is terrible. 4 clicks to book a car because of splash screen of promotions I don’t want, choice between car and food (I obviously want a car!), inaccurate location (Uber gets it right every time). Location listing is inaccurate and misses places/exits plus mixes two languages on the same line which makes it hard to choose. No estimation of arrival time before you book. No way to cancel while booking is being processed, e.g. because it takes too long to get a car.

Driver training is bad. After confirmation, inevitably the driver starts messaging you telling where he is, “I’m comjng”, which means I have to waste my time responding while the info is already clear on the app.

Cancellation policy is outrageous. With a police state “blame the customer and milk it” mindset, after 4 cancellations for whatever reason, the customer is charged a cancellation fee. Now cancellations usually happen because the driver is 15 min away and the customer doesn’t want to be late (the arrival time is not shown until the booking is confirmed), or because the driver is lost and doesn’t want to cancel with excuses like “my phone doesn’t work” (presumably not to be penalised himself). These two events are all but rare and Gfab blames it on the customer. 

Customer service is in existent. No phone number is provided in the app and any email enquiries result in standard answers that only prove that the agent either has not read, or could not understand, or could not address this issue.

In a nutshell: a badly-copied Uber wannabe with a pathetic UX and customer service mindset.",1,Terrible,HommeLibre73,GrabFood

Ordered Grab Food today, when driver arrived he deposited the wrong order at my door, at the same time set status to delivered and was about to leave when we told him order was wrong and he received a call from Grab telling him the other customer also received a wrong order. So he took the order to deliver to the other person while I told him I would call in to cancel my order since you never know what the other person did. I didn’t get a chance to take a photo since he took it away.

First call I made, was told at the end that I would receive a refund within 24 hours and also an email about this after being put on hold twice because the CSO had to “consult her team”

Didn’t receive email, so I called back to ask if the email is with the refund or am I missing something and was told my case is classified as the food did not arrive and was pending review and is within 3 days not 24 hours...

Customer support really should be better and more consistent (there should be an SOP for these cases or similar since I keep reading in the comments it happens quite a bit). And now I have to wait 3 days to know if I can get a refund?

First Review content:

Contemplated writing a review on numerous occasions but can’t let today’s episode pass so....

4.30pm, tried to book a grab from Bishan CC - fee was $9.30. No one accepted and told whether wanted to wait and fee had gone up to $13.30. Tried 2 more times at higher fee, no one accepted booking again, so I decided to walk over to the MRT (because of fail I can get a taxi from the taxi stand). Changed location to Bishan MRT to try one last time, and finally got one grab at $15.30 and at 4.45pm - but he was 10 mins away (or so it showed). Ended up waiting 15 mins for it to show up instead. 

If I had know I’ll waited till 5 to be able to be on a grab to be on the way at a higher rate also, I’ll have taken the public transport to save money while ended up at my destination at faster.",1,Don’t understand pricing and couldn’t get a grab,Dainty dose,GrabFood

Recent addition of just 20c as a platform fee on top of small order fees and increased rider prices really requires you to spend at least $20+ to get food. Other food websites don’t have nearly the same amount of costs with the same amount of variety. Easily spending 5-10 dollars less on other sites.

The promotions are very dodgy, they hide the promo on the days they are out and feature them on the days they don’t apply. If you want the promo to work you need to copy the promo code ahead of time. Most of the promos also don’t apply to food delivery but random gift cards or grab mart, which is the Grocery delivery. 

The rewards for grab points are also incredibly shallow. 3 months free Spotify for platinum? You would’ve spent hundreds if not close to a thousand dollars on the app to even get to that level. Other than that all your points can get wiped for an ‘amazing’ $5 off Starbucks. 

Other sites actually offer discounts on restaurants and you get rewarded after a few orders. Even other cab apps automatically apply discounts where applicable.

Rides and deliveries also are getting slower. Often drivers are taking multiple rides and it seems as if the company is overworking their drivers to save the bottom line. I am a platinum user myself and the “premium” feature is that I get rides faster. This almost never seems to be the case.

Do you know that it is a waste of time and resource?

In UX, the merchant has to call the customer (me) to change for something else. But there’s nothing I want but they can’t cancel the order. And the customer (me) has to do it. So Grab, will cancel the partial order and do the refund. Don’t you think it is just plain stupid? BECAUSE IT IS A FACT THAT MERCHANTS CANNOT HAVE INFINITE INVENTORY AND NO INDICATION OF AVAILABLE STOCK THAT RESULTS IN 3 PARTIES (MERCHANT, CONSUMER AND GRAB) HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER JUST TO CANCEL ONE FUCKING ORDER!!!!

Never ever order more than 1 quantity from Grab mart. There’s always an issue and merchants would call and say that there’s not enough to fulfill the orders.

I had placed order (#GF-561T) on 2 May 2020, 7.19pm for 3 food items from WAWA Seafood on self-collection.

GrabFood App had indicated that the order will be ready for collection by 7.32pm. Hence, I had to rush over to the collection address as it takes around 18 mins by foot.

When I arrived at the premises, I was shocked when the staff said they have yet to prepare my order even though it is 7.34pm and GrabFood App clearly displayed that my order is ready for collection!?

I have to stand in queue with other customers until the order was finally ready for collection at 7.49pm which is 17 mins more than the original indicated time on GrabFood App.

In addition, Wawa Seafood charges their customers an average of additional 30.3% more when ordering on GrabFood App ($33.50) vs placing order in store ($25.70). What is the resolute reason for charging the ridiculous overheads?

Overall, I am very disappointed with GrabFood App and the quality of service rendered despite paying premium price.

So I transferred the AMOUNT NEEDED to GrabPay which was $30 mind you (and I’m a student, very unemployed). And I finally got my food.

Just recently as today took a short Grab Share Ride to 57 Upper Changi Road. Price Quoted was 5.50. I normally take a bus but since I was not feeling well I decided to take a Grab. A Bus ride would have cost 57 cents or more. When I received a receipt it showed $7.50. an extra $2/- for what god only knows. I was not late and was waiting outside my house when the driver arrived in a Hybrid Vehicle. The driver was pretty silent and I directed him the shortest way out of my estate to the main road.
When arrived at Blk 57 and whilst at the Doctors Clinic I received the receipt on my phone and it showed an extra $2/-.
I called Grab help and spoke to them and I was surprised when the lady told me that she has to check with the driver on why there’s an extra $2/-. I am wondering who sets the fares. Is it Grab or the driver ?..... 4.40 is not a peak time and there are no CBD charges in my area.?
The only anomaly is that my house is located on the same stretch of Road but different area there is Limau Bali and Limau Garden and despite putting the postal code 9 out of ten times the driver will go to Limau Bali because it has the same number as my house. Sometimes they refuse to drive less then 60 to 70 meters towards my house even as it is on the same stretch and on many occasions I have walk towards them. 
On some occasions they insist that I put a different address and get annoyed especially if it’s a short ride to Bedok Mall etc etc.
 I don’t wish to argue with them as it not worth my while to get upset.
I never had this problem with Uber and I can see why some of them get angry as some of them complain to me that Grab squeezes them to the maximum and they have to work their arses off to earn a decent living. 
Perhaps this is the answer to the problems as many of us feel the pinch these days.
With the introduction of Gojek island wide I hope that charges become reasonable and I am inclined to switch to them as often as I can.
I have been driving for more than 50 yrs but I am reluctant to drive as I’m in my mid 70s and my eyesight is not that fantastic. 
I sincerely do hope that Grab do some policy changes so that it doesn’t lose its main customer base. I am sure many will switch over to Gojek once they see that their pricing is reasonable and that they don’t squeeze the life out of their Drivers. Happy Drivers Happy Passengers.

To benefit all Grab-for-Work users, please consider to add these 3 functionalities as these would significantly decrease the number of clicks required to book our daily rides: 

1) ability to choose the “default tag” (i.e. business vs personal rides)

2) ability to auto-add “SCORE” promo code when the codes become available

3) ability to have favourite routes (e.g. office to home or vice versa)

#1 and #3 above were available in the older version but are taken out in the current version. This is a rather disappointment and makes things far less efficient. So, we do hope to see these functionalities being restored in the near future.

I have taken 4 rides this month, and do not see any rewards in my account. I effectively have no way to get the discount that I should be getting (as a PAYING subscriber of their “Score” program). 

To make matters worse, when I reached out to the company via the in app help centre, the customer service responses were incredibly disappointing. They informed me that they were looking into the matter and provided no indication of how long it would take, and no resolution to the issue. This is incredibly unfair, as I have to pay full price for all rides, even though I was supposed to be getting 20% off my next 30 rides. 

Seeing that they may be facing some technical difficulties that may require time to resolve, I suggested for them to issue me with replacement code(s) so I can continue enjoying the rides at 20% off, while they are conducting their investigations. The customer service simply reply - no, they can’t do it. That’s it. No reason why, no offering of any solution, still no indication of when they will be resolving the issue and clearly not giving a damn about the user’s situation.

Green background with small white words is very difficult to read.  At least bold the characters and use bigger fonts to make them clearer.

Please remember users are on the go and reading from small mobile phone screens, under all sorts of weather and lightings.  These are very basic considerations.  

Users/Riders don’t look at drivers faces to look for the correct cars to board, but the license plate and preferably the car colour ( please add this info ).

So, driver name and face is secondary info which can be on the 2nd / more detailed screen.

There should also be a platform for users to give feedback on app for improvements.

How can drivers send “ARRIVED” messages ( and users get charged for waiting time ) when they are 5minutes or more away from pick up point?!  That’s fraud.

Worst is when the promo code suddenly claimed to be fully redeemed while attempting to get the ride within that 20 mins.

On a few occasions:

i) no notifications on promo code through the app though I was the selected user (this resulted in the engagement of another service provider)

ii) all notifications went missing

2) App freeze / hang issues

i) A few times, my bookings was not seen by grab drivers (this was what the cs told me) 

ii) Search page was blank green for a very long time and even the cancel button was missing. So I closed the app and opened again. According to cs I had cancelled the booking. 

What is the definition of booking?

The app is still searching for drivers and no booking confirmed yet. It is not a scenario where a driver had been assigned and I cancelled on him. 

iii) Option to enable user to cancel search BEFORE a driver was assigned.

During search, there was a CANCEL button (not cancel booking button) at the bottom of page. If user had clicked on this button, according to the cs this is considered cancellation of bookings. 

Suggest: ""Cancel Search"" button. 

3) Promo code
Please clean up the codes backend rather than requiring user to update the app every time due to code cleanup. 

Today I encountered issue with a promo code for selected users and according to cs, this promo code is still valid as of today. I was advised to update the app and the promo code should work. No, it did not work after the update. So cs said will escalate again and get back to me. In the meantime, do I Grab or not?

1) Although it's the 3rd time the app has gone through a major change in design, it still has not been optimised for iPhone 6(S) & 6(S)+

2) GPS is never accurate. It always tags me at a couple of blocks down the street, even though my phone’s current location shows accurately.

3) When there is a fare surge, it will still be displayed as a 'flat' fare which means your usual route will be more expensive during times like a train breakdown but they wont inform you outright, unlike uber which tells you that there is currently a surge in price.

4) Emailed them about a taxi driver whom arrived at my location and claim that I have arrived at my destination - getting charged for it, never got a reply. 28-Aug-15

5) Took me twice to email them about an issue where my card payment functionality was disabled to get back to me. As usual, the first time I emailed them, no reply. 4-Nov-2015/28-Nov-2015

6)I have always preferred cashless payments as it's more convenient for me especially when I'm in a rush, I don't want to go looking for an ATM.

Now instead, they put a call link to the eatery that we are ordering from under the allergy section.

I actually contacted tech support and asked them if there was an option, and they said that they don't have such a feature. 

So I'm thinking - could we all join in to post (and give a lower-than-5-stars rating) to get Grab/Deliveroo/other food delivery apps to add a post-delivery tip option to tip riders? Some of the riders come from lower-income families, so every missed tip for them (for simple reasons like the customer remembered only just right after the rider went off) can be a significant one.

In fact, we can even add a wet-weather reminder to our users to encourage them to tip extra to our friends who brave dangerous wet weather to safely deliver food to us who are comfortably waiting at home.

Really hope we can include a post-delivery tip feature in the next update. Every dollar matters to our riders who

As frustrated as I am, I was also confident that it was the app mistakes and not my payment information’s fault. After 30mins of debating whether my card information was the issue or not, the CS(after speaking to the manager<<initially thought my card was the problem also) can finally conclude that my checkout value did not meet the required of $0.50.

I had been a long time user of Deliveroo for years and because i ordered in frequently, i had decided to sign up for their Deliveroo Plus to have my delivery fees waived. And although, recently, they amended their policy to have a minimum charge of $18 in order to qualify for their delivery fee waiver, i was still ok with this change. Recently due to some technical issues with the App about the delivery addresses not properly reflected, i had to contact them. However, no contact number could be found even in the Contact Us link. Hence, i had to use their online chat for help, which you could imagine how difficult it was to communicate my exact problems accurately to them. They responded quick but the help given was utterly disappointing. They had advised me to completely delete away my account and reinstall it without giving me due information on the repercussions that were to follow. And of course, i followed their instructions because i was so hungry and wanted to order my food immediately after reinstallation. After deleting and reinstalling, i realised that my Deliveroo Plus was forcibly terminated. So, i had to go back to the online chat, by which time, another person is attending to me and i had to repeat the story all over again to get the online help up to date. As the problem had to typed out, it was messy and convoluted and i was getting hungrier by the minute. Eventually, the help i got was that i had to wait for a few days in order to have my Deliveroo Plus reinstated. My simple question is, why couldn’t this be explained and informed to me before i had to delete my account away. Please note that I could still have ordered my food before the saga by just reentering my addresses. I had only wanted to know why and what was wrong with the App storing the addresses i had entered earlier, but i ended up having my Deliveroo Plus wiped out.

1. each time payment fails have to readd everything ONE BY ONE — no reorder from previous order except from successful orders 
2. payments always on and off have issues — using the same card for monthly sub deduction yet it can fail. just ridiculous. 
3. forced to change password by saying account locked due to fraudulent activities — even more ridiculous. could place order via apple wallet but told me it’s locked. so what do i do? swap the default card in my wallet DUH! 
4. stupid glitches don’t allow under order or exact use of credits — lol ridiculously i managed to under order once, prob coz it was a combination of 2 credits and since my order fully utilised 1 credit it was successful. 
5. although the CS is faster since there’s live chat, always encountering error when you first click for it. always 2nd try works like a charm. 
6. no such help available for failed orders — it’s like i don’t need assistance when your app fails...
7. good CS recovery on food related queries but technical issues totally CMI — they know nothing!!
8. not to forget to mention, still ridiculous IT issue — forever unable to select vouchers/credits to use. always first in first out. so user unfriendly. 
9. extra to add on — tipping. what makes us wanna tip a rider before we even encounter/receive the food? it’s really a no brainer. are you saying no tips no good delivery service?
10. delivery address incorrect doesn’t matter nearby or updates they won’t do it for you. solution? call the rider while they are busy riding to restaurant or cancel the order (which the app glitches & only CSO can) but unable to coz CSO TOO SLOW. once restaurant accepts & starts preparing then too late. lol quite a joke.

1129,2021-05-28 07:07:17,False,,"Deliveroo has terrible customer service. 

I ordered items from a supermarket. One of them was a packet of fresh fruits which arrived rotten. I took photo and submitted to deliveroo, requesting for a refund. 

Deliveroo ignored the email completely. I waited for one week (the usual business SOP 3-5 working days) and there was still no reply. Their website does not offer you a hotline number to call. I had to google for the number. 

Only after that call did I receive an email notification from deliveroo that the money would be refunded. 

However, the disappointing episode did not end here. 

Instead of refunding me the amount that was stated in the email, only a portion of it was refunded to my credit card bill. 

I went to my app and discovered that Deliveroo has quietly refunded the remaining portion into my account as credit. Deliveroo did not inform me about this credit. This credit has a near expiry date. It also has many conditons, one of which stating that I have to fork out at least another $20 in order to redeem the credit, and it was only valid for the supermarket which gave me rotten fruits. 

Essentially, Deliveroo displayed many counts where integrity is questionable. 

The money that should have been refunded to me was claimed back from the supermarket. Instead of returning me the full sum, Deliveroo retained a portion of it.  It did not inform me that I had credits in my account. Once expired, the credits would have been invalid and Deliveroo would have happily pocketed my money. 

Also, it is incredulous that Deliveroo expected the customer to fork out more money in a supermarket that has let them down. 

I emailed Deliveroo and asked for clarification on the observations. The email came after a long time. They skirted the topic and coldly stated the company’s policy. 

They did not explain why I was not informed of the credit which had a near expiry date, neither did they explain the condition of forcing me to re-order from the same supermarket which gave me rotten items. Most of all, it was not explained why I was forced to fork out more money in order to claim for full refund of a rotten item received. 

Deliveroo’s Facebook platform doesn’t allow customer reviews, and with such poor service, it’s clear why this is so.  

 Deliveroo must improve on their service in all aspects - customer service and service recovery. A good step in doing so is to respond timely and learn from your competitors.",1,Poor customer service,moo-sg987,Deliveroo

2) Deliveroo gave excuse that their rider came to near to my place but due to ‘complications’, wasn’t able to deliver. 

3) When questioned on what was the complication, Deliveroo didn’t give any specific reason. Instead, Deliveroo said that there was one missed call given. Also, there was email sent. 

4) Explained that I didn’t have access to my hp. Clear instructions were given to Deliveroo on the gate access, on the steps of what to do. Clearly, the Deliveroo person didn’t press the gate access.  If he has pressed, the alarm would have rang. The security also confirmed that the gate access is in good working order. 

5) All Deliveroo kept doing is repeat standard replies “I understand how you feel”, “your feedback is taken” and “I am sorry this happened to you” like zombies and gave unreasonable reply like “this is our terms that customer must maintain communication with rider”. Refused to take the case on its merits and refused to give any explanation on the so called complications. 

6) If Deliveroo policy is to take your money without food delivery, as Long as they have given you one missed call and send you one email, then this sort of unfair terms should be clearly communicated to all customers. I have ordered thousand of dollars of food from Deliveroo and I will stop ordering from this unfair vendor. I will also direct my bank to stop this unfair payment charge.

Long story cut short, I waited for a good one hour only to have my order cancelled in the end because rider is too far away from the delivery point. Thanks to the screwed up map provider where the pin was wrongly dropped on the map.

Look Deliveroo Management Team, you guys had one job - to see to food deliveries on a timely basis. If the map provider is constantly giving you recurring issues like that, jolly well fix it asap. Do you guys not see how grave a problem this is? If you are not even able to get the delivery address right, how can you even call qualify yourself as a food delivery service provider?

Please also train your staff to think out of the box. Different situations call for different forms of service recovery. $5 food voucher to compensate for an hour delay followed by a cancelled order is ridiculous. The least the team should do is to match the cancelled food order cost. Or have the rider take a cab and deliver the food. Bottom line is, just SEE TO THE ORDER AND ENSURE THE FOOD GETS DELIVERED. If the order was taken, it should be honoured. Just letting you guys know that this is absolutely terrible service recovery. 

You don’t just try to shut the customer up with a pathetic $5 voucher and by telling the customer to place another order by shifting the pin on the map yada when the customer is already peeved. You mean the management actually thinks the customer is still going to stupidly proceed with another order after being scammed for an hour?

I think I should also add that a call was made to Deliveroo halfway through my order when the first rider informed me that he was unable to fulfil the delivery order due to proximity issues. The staff who picked my call simply said another rider would be assigned without even looking into the root cause of the issue. If he did, at least we could have just ended things there and then.

1522,2019-08-12 10:30:54,False,,"When the app first launched, it offered great meals at very affordable prices. This made it a true contender amongst food delivery apps despite a messy interface. However, not only are the actual offers gone, prices have hiked. Here’s my feedback:

1. Deceiving promotional meals 

Perhaps you may have received MULTIPLE notifications daily informing you that they have $12 meals, etc. However, these meals are not actually a deal at all, and is often pricier than the actual price in restaurants.

Their competitors like Foodpanda and Grabfood offer actual promotional deals, and is not intrusive in app notifications.  

2. Ridiculous delivery fees

It is pretty obvious that this is a gimmick to get customers to subscribe to Deliveroo Plus, for a whopping $14.90 per month (4 people can get 4K Netflix for the same price!!). The delivery fees range from $4.50-$6.50, one of the most expensive platforms ever. It’s likely calculated by distance - closer restaurants cost $4.50, etc. 

Competitor prices:
Grabfood - influences by demand. Delivery fees from $3 to $5. Albeit a bit expensive, they partner with a lot of restaurants to occasionally offer free delivery. 
Foodpanda - $0.99 to $2.99. Fixed price, in accordance to distance. This is hands down the cheapest option out there. They also partner up with restaurants to offer free delivery. Additionally, their delivery fees actually fell through the course of this year! Restaurants close to me usually cost $1.49 to delivery but the cost fell to $0.99!!!

3. Slow customer support

The app advertised a $3 off $12 code for a particular restaurant but after various tries it failed to work. Customer service offered little help to resolve the issue. 

4. Additional promo codes

There are almost no active campaigns offered by Deliveroo. 

Grabfood allows you to redeem vouchers using your accumulated points, and you can even purchase Grabfood vouchers at a discount on platforms like Shopee. 
Foodpanda has partnered up with DBS to give $15 vouchers (no min spend) for $100 spent on groceries every month, and rewarded me with a $10 voucher for opting out of utensils after a certain number of orders as a token of appreciation for helping save the environment.

There is a clear lack of initiative by Deliveroo to make prices more affordable.",1,Worse with each new feature,404waldonotfound,Deliveroo

Dear Gino,

I have yet to receive any instructions of funds inflow for any indicative settlement date upon checking with the Banking Operations Department of POSB/DBS. This indicates that no instruction hasn’t been placed by your banker/banking system to facilitate a reversal of funds outflow back to original account. Please proceed to do so and in the next email, please provide proof of banking instruction given and the settlement date for funds oweing to me of about $100+ (if I am not wrong with this figure, pls check and refund appropriate amount).

It is a simple banking instruction that can be retrieved and presented to the Client upon request. Under anti-money laundering laws, ALL countries are able to present full disclosure when required by receipoent/other part suspecting fraudulent activities might be involved; am afraid I do and because I am away money market funds settle T+2 so by right I should have my funds by today, but POSB/DBS do not see any such inflow of transactional instructions in the banking system with MAS as well as their on intranet.

If you should claim that such a request is not possible and not able to provide full refund by today or not able to substantiate that instructions Re underway to provide a refund (thence also provide settlement date of refunds); then I beg to differ as GO DADDY, SHOPIFY and WIX BLOG were all able to provide such soft copies of substantiation to my solicitor upon his request akin to the request placed forth to you now.

I await a favourable reply today. Otherwise, there will be a contention between the legal regularity of the flow of funds where refunds are concerned versus Deliveroo and its management of funds. I believe there are sufficient input online regarding he misappropriation of funds back to your Clients on Google...I hope not to include one more.

Regds,

My email reply (latest)==>
I am walking to the Singapore Tanglin Police Station as we speak. I have asked POSB AND DBS to work with the Police’s financial intelligence team to investigate your end of the banking system. Should there be no claims or findings idof payment issues, there will be a charge of falsehood as with intent to cheat under our Corruption and Investigation Bareau on you Gino as the actions and instructions/advise were provided by your kind self unless u can provide evidence to absolve yourself of all blame. It will be a charge that Deliveroo will have to deal with on an institutional level of u are not available for the charges pressed against u after investigations. I hope Deliveroo is well advised of that.

Take this email as evidence that the above mentioned tentative actions that will entail within the next few hours. 

Should you require a legal correspondent to liaise with. Please speak with my solicitor from Lee & Lee Advocates and Solicitors.

I've tried to resolve this with Deliveroo support, multiple emails and calls, but they're refusing to fully refund the order saying it's ""their policy not to"". I'm left with disputing the transaction with my credit card company & leaving this review so others can judge if this is really a company they want to do business with.

(b) Had an order cancelled on me AFTER the food was picked up because offshore customer service claimed that my location was too far for it to be “safe” for the delivery rider to fulfill the order. Note the irony here - the customer has paid for the food, Deliveroo now cancels the order (and pays the cost for doing so, as if it has so much capital to burn and yet stay afloat) -> hangry customer.

(c) Offshore customer service was absolutely robotic with no bone of pro-activity within them. I wasn’t expecting a voucher code since they cancelled my order on me at close to 9pm. The least they could have done was offer me some alternatives and then expedite the order for me.

It’s not even the case that you have to buy a certain amount to get the free delivery - (a) the app doesn’t tell you how much you have to order to get it and (b) I’ve experimented by putting an order of over $60 and the delivery fee was still there. 

Admin, if you’re charging delivery fees, be upfront and say so. Let the customer decide from the very beginning with the full information of how much his order will cost.

1. Poor APP not able handle cancellation and real time status. 

2. Poor management from FOODPANDA itself. At least have the courtesy, please inform customer when an order is being canceled so we dont expect and WAIT for nothing.
~~~~~~~~
I placed an ordered from Golden Jade Palace with est delivery 25-30mins. After 30mins, I received an SMS notifying “order will be a bit late”. i just waited coz this app status shows food still being prepared with “1 min” more to go. Until another 30 mins long wait with same app status & timing when i followed up thru chat, the support told that my order was actually canceled, but this app is not able to show real time status and proper trasaction update.. keeping me wait that long without any food delivery!

Apparently, the reason for cancellation was that the price in the menu is incorrect for one of the item i ordered. Thus, the WHOLE ORDER WAS CANCELED. In this case, I understand financial impact on  Golden Jade Palace’ side. But, if this APP is not reliable, then it is not fair to just cancel order without notifying the customer.  

From my side, as a customer, to ensure my order will arrive, how would i know which item from the menu is shown with correct pricing??",5,Poor app. Not showing real time order status,BillTrackerUser,FoodPanda

In addition, I just encountered one problem with the app. This happened when I was trying to see if I am able to get to view all my ordered items, while doing that the app just sent out my order without me authorizing it. This is scary though I was lucky to quickly get on the chat line to cancel the incomplete order.

When Customer Support was asked why was the restaurant listed as available, the answer didn't make sense. The response was Food Panda only knows about the restaurant being closed or open only after a customer makes an order. What the heck! Shouldn't they be updating their list so customers don't go through the hassle of ordering only to find out the restaurant is closed? And worse, they charge your card first.

At first, the customer service would be polite and would even extend vouchers for inconvenience, but now it’s so ridiculous. 

I had an order that was running an hour late by the time I could reach a customer service operator she literally said “your eta is 5.30pm” to which I said “well... it’s 6.30 now so... where is it?” Then she put me on hold for 10 minutes, tells me she’s changed the delivery driver (even though I don’t know if that was the problem) and tells me it’ll reach me in 30 min. Another hour passes I talk to another operator, a different operator who finds out I’ve already spoken to her colleague but had no idea, all she can do is apologise and I was fed up. Food arrived 2.5 hours late (meaning I waited 3.25 hours after ordering), it was cold, the drink had seeped through the container, I was just done... if I want to complain about a meal, it takes literally days to file a complaint and get a refund.

138,2017-10-25 05:44:35,False,,"Any benefits Food Panda might offer in comparison to Ubereats or Deliveroo are lost due to non-existent customer support.

The new interface is a poor imitation of Ubereats and makes it difficult to browse through restaurants.

Delivery is frequently delayed or incorrect. It looks like delivery riders are not instructed to verify that the order is correct, not even with a cursory glance.

The failings above could be played down if customer support was actually helpful which sadly is not the case.

There are only 2 ways to contact support, chat and email.
Chat takes forever to connect to you with support staff who will promptly put you on hold for 3-5 mins. Better stick your nose into the screen while you’re waiting because you will get disconnected for inactivity whenever the staff decide to get back to you.
Email is a waste of time as the mailbox doesn’t seem to be monitored.

2639,2021-11-03 23:01:09,False,,"Used the app for around 2 Years, used it a lot especially since COVID-19. Was a pandapro user. Throughout the years I met with a lot of problems. Food Delayed > 1 Hour Multiple times, App Shows delivered but it is not delivered multiple times, food spoiled/cold many times which i don’t really care tbh, Customer service feels like talking to a slow bot, at least a bot can respond immediately. The order which made me decide to stop using this app was when the order was delayed for an hour. so I have waited for 90 Minutes. after that the order was marked as delivered but it was not delivered when I went out to check. Contacted the customer support and the support cannot provided any help and just proceeded to refund and cancel my order without any sort of compensation as what they usually gave ($2 voucher or something). The money then refunded to my pandapay account. I contacted the support, again, to ask for a transfer to my original payment method since I won’t use the app again. The support doesn’t know that you can ask for the transfer and said he cannot help with it and was sorry for it. It’s literally there in the Terms and Conditions that I may ask for the transfer. It tooks him more than 15 minutes just to confirm this… The funny thing is, after My order was cancelled, I ordered from another app. The order from another app was delivered, faster than expected time, I eat the food, and the customer service still can’t give back my refund. The more I use the app, the more I feel like their service is getting worse. If you have not use any food delivery app, Don’t use this app and just try another app instead. Trust me, It’s worth your time. If you already use the app, maybe you should rethink your life choices. Sometimes, some things must be left behind.",1,Bad App,Cruxifixus,FoodPanda

They tend to send wrong food orders almost every single time. Just within a month, I've received at least 3 wrong orders and their resolution is sending template response like a robot and refund you the value of the food via voucher just to have your money locked in the platform. There's no customer centric mindset in this platform, their main objective is just to trap your money into their platform and provide no service to you. Agents are of almost no help, they send you to different department to confuse you, sending different template responses like a robot again so I don't know why don't they just use AI or robot instead? There's no human touch or interaction despite speaking to a human from this app. I tried getting refund back to my credit card and they staff just hang up on me after saying their policy doesn't allow so. This is the service you'll expect if you use foodpanda so use at your own risk. I'm sure you can get better value of your money and service from competitors like grab and deliveroo. This is by far the worst food delivery app and doesn't value customer service at all. I can't recall how many times (too many times) agent hang up and end the conversation just because they can't find a resolution to the issue. They just mark your issue as resolved even when it's not so be prepared to keep repeating and opening new request just to have your issue resolved.

What I wasn't fine about was how the app and the company started sending emails and messages that the food was delivered at 9:17 when it wasn't. The timer from the app disappeared (since my food was supposedly delivered) and I had totally no more info from the current delivery on the app, besides showing that it was already delivered. The app only had two options, either online chatting with them or email, so I decided chatting. But within the 20/30 minute range that I had tried to contact them through chat, no agent responded to me and even the phone number online was not contactable. The food eventually came around 9:40, but with totally no notification that the rider was going to be late and no explanation given that they would be late (I understand that it's in the T&C that they might be late because of traffic etc), but providing a notification when you will be 30 minutes late isn't a very hard thing to do? Moreover the rider was really unapologetic and just passed me the food without any reason at all. I didn't wait that long but the panic from not receiving the food and having to worry about refunds and whether I needed to order again wasn't a very pleasant experience and it didn't help that there was absolutely no reliable avenue where I could ask for help or some service?

2866,2019-12-24 05:03:35,False,,"I have been a long time consumer of Food Panda and recently things are starting to take a turn. These are four different incidents that occured within two months. 

The first incident was my order went through despite the restaurant has already been closed and I was only notified an hour afters so I was waiting for literally nothing. 

Secondly on two separate occasions my orders were being deemed as delivered despite not receiving my food, both drivers were uncontactable in the occasions. 

And the most recent one which happened yesterday was when a bug occured during ordering. I have made an order just to receive an error saying that something went wrong so please try ordering again. Upon doing so, I was surprised that I received two orders as my card payment went through for both of them but on my app how could you possibly reflect two drivers? I then contacted Food Panda only to receive this. 

Thank you for contacting foodpanda. 

Sorry for the unpleasant experience you have faced due to getting placed similar order twice.

Upon checking details we can see that both of your orders are successfully delivered to you and we hope that they are arrived in good condition. 

You should report this issue before your orders got accepted by the restaurant so that we could fix this for you but as you have reported this after your orders are delivered to you therefore refund is not applicable in this scenario.

But the recent encounter really leave a bad taste and this shall be my last interaction with them. I have placed a food order at 4.30pm for the food to be delivered to my home at 8pm. At 7.30pm they have sent a notification that the order has to be cancelled as the the food that I have ordered has run out of stock. Kidding me, it took them almost 3.5 hours to realize that the ingredients are unavailable. No customer service hotline, I have to resort to chat with the customer service online. The next thing I know is that the customer service only apologize without offering alternative. Oh come on, anyone who is in customer service should have know about offering alternative and service recovery beside apologizing, this should help to mitigate customer frustration. In foodpanda, do not expect them to offer any other alternatives such as replacement of the original  order and etc. what they know is to apologize. Really poor service recovery and handling over this matter. This shall be my last interaction with them. 

To foodpanda: I am not into your compensation and etc as I can easily afford them, all these does not matter anymore due to poor handling on the customer service. You need to brush up on the service recovery skill and manage your customer. Apology always come with service recovery. And I don’t see that being practice in Foodpanda.

My order was confirmed at 7.12pm. At 8.30pm, app status said order is on the way. At 8.31pm, app status changed to ""order delay"" and said to contact customer service through live chat on the app if my order is not delivered 10min later. At 8.42pm, I started the live chat (mind you, this is the only way to get hold of foodpanda customer svc as they terminated their hotline phone number). It said 9 customers before me so asked me to wait. Someone entered the chat at 8.50pm, gave a standard ""hi, we are here to serve you, what's the issue"" and then went radio silence after I explained the situation and asked for advice. Silence.. silence.. silence and at 9.05pm, the customer service left the chat!! I couldn't continue the live chat and had to exit the app, launch the app and start a fresh live chat. And there were 26 customers ahead of me this time before the customer svc can attend to my live chat!!! Finally, someone attended to my live chat and started again with ""hi, we are here to serve you, what's the issue"".. i was floored – don't they have the info in their system instantly since the ordering and live chat are on the same app?!! The (same) customer service apologised for the earlier drop in chat as the app was ""facing technical glitch"".

3013,2020-01-23 03:55:54,False,,"A significantly inferior app to other food delivery apps. There aren't enough drivers so my order took 1 hour and 30 minutes for a chicken salad. The order prior to that's occurred a year earlier and my order got canceled after 1 hour so the driver didn't show up  at all. I stopped using the app completely because of this incident but after a year decided to but encountered the same experience as described above. I had to call into customer service and they said they would give me a voucher immediately. Two days later I did receive it. 

The interface is clunky, I was forwarded to an advertisement splash page and the ""x"" to minimize the ad is placed purposefully so far on the top right hand of the screen that you actually can't close the window. I had to then close the app multiple times and reopen from scratch but because the app had to be closed my order was lost and I had to start from scratch.

Finally, the user experience when ordering makes absolutely no sense. For example if you order a salad with various toppings, instead of being able to simply add toppings by selecting multiple ingredients under a single table, it forces you to choose only one singular ingredient listed in multiple tables relisting the same ingredients again. This forces the users to scroll up and down this huge list of repetitive tables if they want to verify the ingredients they chose. How does this format make any sense at all? 

Long long long way to go before they catch up their peers in the industry. One positive thing though is that they do have some good restaurant selection.",1,Brutal Service and User Interface,tekara1,FoodPanda

3028,2020-01-07 20:05:07,False,,"I was an frequent user for foodpanda since they came out. Even after other delivery service app came out I was still using it. But after the following event, I decided that it’s not worth using it anymore. 

I made an order at 1235 and it shows 35mins waiting time. At around 1315, it shows 1 min waiting time till I received the order at 1400. 

I understand that there’s lots of order going on. But what’s with the fake 35mins at the start and  subsequently 1 min waiting time shown in the app? If it’s gonna take estimated 1 hour then they should have shown 1 hour. 

I only received the order at 1400hrs which is almost 1 hour delay with the app telling me 1 min waiting time for more than 30mins. I could have went to eat something else or do something but instead I waited like an idiot for tons of 1 mins. And they didn’t even bother to inform me that it will be late.

I contacted the customer service twice as I was out for lunchtime and I have to rush back to office. Both time they said that it will arrive 15mins later which it didn’t. I asked for refunds but they said I could cancel it but there will be no refunds or any compensation. 

Afterwards I wrote an email asking for explanation. I even received the automatic reply saying that they received my mail and will reply with 3-5 working days. It’s been almost 3-4 weeks and I have receive any replies. 

There was another event whereas my brother order ~7 drinks. During the delivery, the store called and said that the delivery guy forgot 4 drinks. Since we have no means of contacting him, we can only wait. When he reached, he just said that it’s not his fault and walked off. Was it’s my fault instead then?

We contacted the customer service and after a long period of waiting for their replies, we manage to get back the refunds + 10-15$ compensation( which only came at the following week) in the form of foodpanda credits. What we wanted was the drinks which they didn’t bother to resolve the mistake by sending it agn. And by the time we tried to reorder, the store has closed. It didn’t just affect me but my family and relatives who was waiting and looking forwards to the drinks. 

I’m really disappointed at their services despite having using it for so long. It’s obvious that they are not trying to resolve these issues. I’m sure it will happen agn hence I’m not gonna use it anymore to prevent further disappointment and inconvenience",1,Inaccurate delivery timing and bad customer service,Tgtffff,FoodPanda

The most disappointed is, after they email me about cancelling my membership. The delivery start to go wrong. 
Yesterday I ordered 3 bubble milk tea, only came 2. When I contact them, they say they will give me $6 voucher as compensation. I requested the customer service to send me the missing order coz I can’t order just 1 bubble milk tea, it’s doesn’t hit the minimum $5 of panda order rule. But customer service just reply say :” we can’t do that from our side. What else I can assist u?”

Tonight, I ordered Pho Street from compass one at 8.14pm, it’s show will take 20 to 30mins. 8.50pm I saw the apps show rider picked up. From compass one to my place take less than 10mins. So 9pm I texted the rider if he is on the way. He said yes! 
9.20pm, I contact the customer service to complain about it, the rider collect it more than 30mins alr. But he still not here yet. 
The customer service only reply :” rider will reach within specific time. What else I can assist u?” 
Seriously?! Did u even solve my problem? The customer service will keep asking :” what else I can asssist u?” U didn’t help me at all!! 
End up I received my food at 9.30pm, soup spilled, food cold! But the customer service attitude is totally bad! They don’t even care!

2. Arrived finally and got the order wrong - only a third of the items was delivered.
3. “HQ” made their delivery guy wait for 30 minutes until their “HQ/hotline” decides the next step 
4. “HQ” Instructed me to make full payment so the delivery guy can leave and continue his other orders. Was told refund will be made. Paid full amount as didn’t want to hold back foodpanda delivery staff.
5. Got back a few days later saying there’s nothing they can do about it.
6. Followed up with them a few days later and was attended by a helpdesk staff who was upset with me for not understanding “there’s nothing we can do”
7. Finally relented to escalate to a manager and made BIG promise to get back within 2 days
8. My mistake, I forgot about this incident (as I’ve got my own life to live) and they conveniently forgot about it, with their BIG promise.
9. Followed up a week later, was told they will give us a $10 voucher if we spent $50 in or next purchase. Wow.
10. Asked if this was a elaborate scam, conveniently forgot about us again. 
11. Still don’t know where my money went.

I am guessing the owner/s at foodpanda was a wide eyed, ambitious young group of people who, unfortunately with the years of work experience combined, don’t understand the importance of an SLA in the world of business continuity (or customer service), never really bothered to do due diligence as their business got too big, too fast and made some needlessly reckless blunder by signing up with in my experience, possibly the crappiest customer service company in India, locked in a multi year deal without a get out clause and now you are stucked. There were never any plans to create a damage control team because wide eyed owner was invincible until the day he laid his eyes on the worst customer service company, and now, you can’t help but watch your once beautiful app designer/owner dream disintegrate slowly and painfully into oblivion.",1,Business owners of Foodpanda worst I have experienced with customer service,Aloysiustay,FoodPanda

8 Years passed and I managed to save a sum of money for the down payment of my dream car. However my dreams were dashed when a good friend of mine, Pete, ended up in the hospital due to an accident. I knew right away that he needed the money I worked so hard for to pay for the hospital bills as he had no family left to help him.  Pete and I were childhood friends and we shared the same dream of being successful together one day. He was the only friend I had that understood the struggles I faced just to live the posh live that I so dearly yearned for.

Weeks passed and Pete was still in a coma, the hospital bill sky rocketed and my savings were close to depleting. With no signs of hope that Pete will survive this ordeal, I decided to let him go. Moments before the doctors pulled the plug on Pete, I had one final moment to say goodbye. I entered the room again to see Pete lay motionless on the bed. With every remorse, I mustered the strength to pull myself together to say good bye.

Years passed since the day I lost my best friend. My finances never recovered too and any hopes of buying the red Lamborghini went together with it. As I sat on the street, I couldn’t help but regret that I didn’t use that money to buy a car so that I need not rely on your service again.",1,Huge dilemma,Phythonia,FoodPanda

We have ordered from FoodPanda on numerous occasions and find their app very user-friendly and reliable with a good mix of various cuisines available for our delivery zone. The app, together with the SMS messages sent upon every order placed, is fantastic as it allows us to keep track of our order status.
Delivery service so far has always been impeccable and we are very pleased with the prompt, timely, efficient and friendly delivery service provided by their delivery personnel.
On the very rare occasion that we had to contact their customer service hotline for a missing/wrong order put out by a food outlet, we were very pleased with the friendly and proactive customer service personnel who promptly and efficiently resolved the issue to our satisfaction.

After order was placed, I didn't received any delivery at my promised delivery time. A call was made and my food finally came 2 hours after order was made. By that time, my food had gone lukewarm. I decided to reject my order and seek a refund. 

A check with the delivery guy why my order was late, he claimed no one wants to deliver my food. Can you belief that?

Seeking refund also wasn't an automatic choice, neither did any party bother to call or even offer to compensate me & my family for missing our dinner.

I gotta call them up personally days later before my refund was processed.

I subsequently gave FP another go and this time, food was delivered on time.

Couple minutes later, another guy called saying that my order was cancelled because they don't deliver to my area???? But I entered in my area before they showed me the list of restaurants that I could order from???? 
This really isn't the worst compared to that time when the lady predicted that there will be heavy rain at my area in 30 minutes so they can't deliver (no, it didn't rain the entire day sad to say I was hyped up on the idea that there might be a god in customer service)

We are sorry that you had a missing/wrong item in your order r3rh-usxc. We can understand this situation is frustrating for you.

We will remind the restaurant to be more careful in the future when preparing the orders, to avoid such situations from recurring. This is indeed not the type of experience we strive for.

Based on your past history of issues with orders, we regret to inform you that you are not eligible for refund as you have exceeded the threshold limit of claiming refunds. Going forward, if your order success rate improves you may regain the refund claim for the future orders. Your understanding would be highly appreciable.

We hope that your next experience with us would be a good one. Should you have other queries, please do reply to this email or you may contact us via Live Chat for immediate assistance.

Rider claimed he threw away $78 worth of undelivered food (from Luo Huo Guo Star Vista) when he failed to contact me after 4 calls - he pushed me to the live chat to retrieve the food.

At the live chat platform, Tanmoori closed the interaction after a cursory apology about the unfortunate scenario.  

This is certainly an unsavory response to a customer’s query - a very poor reflection of the food panda despatch system and customer service management.

We have been ordering food regularly as of Sat 30/11/2019 from Park Avenue Rochester. The least the rider could have done is to have left the food with the hotel reception or could have contacted the despatch supervisor to seek advice on the follow up action instead of throwing away $78 worth of food.

Anyone out there has an equally bad experience with Food Panda ? Do we lose faith in this food despatch company over this rider and live chat personnel ?",1,Rider disposed food after failed call,Adagiodance,FoodPanda

The story was the location was being evacuated as the place was on fire. So the driver dial me to explain everything and when I found out I was like wow great service provided by the company , doesn’t even bother to pick up the call 

So I contacted three Customer service agents. I told the first one the situation and he keep saying sorry and I gave up waiting for his response so I ended the chat. The second one was just an retarded FYI
I told the second one the situation and she told me the same thing so at this point I just ask her to cancel and she said the driver is on the way , so I called the driver and the driver told me he was still at the location waiting for the foodpanda dispatcher to Pick UP the Damn Phone .
So I got back to the foodpanda app and she left to chat as I was typing . So I contacted the third one and  I once again explain every single thing and he once again said sorry for the hassle , and I am here just wanting to eat

So okay I clicked on Help, to see if anything could be done. Explained the situation, cso said nothing could be done and hung up. Tried again, got an email to contact and msged Facebook again. Told me that the code was “not real” and that I should make sure of the code being input. I explained again that it showed the final price before I input my payment details, and that this was misleading (why would a fake code still be allowed to show a -$15 discount?) and that there might be a possibility of an app glitch.

Food is late. The app said that they will investigate. But almost 1 hour later, there is no update, no news. They gave a phone number to call in. But number not in use. They asked you to use live chat instead. After 1/2 hour, no one answer my questions. 
And the most funny thing is the restaurant is 12 minutes walking distance from my house. I was sick so not walking out. Else could have gotten the food myself and save all these troubles. 
Food is not hot when delivered. 
No communication means frustrated customer!

I complained to the panda support in vain that I have not keyed in the address neither any one delivered or bothered to call and ask if they can handover the food to someone other than me.the panda response was worst they said check with restaurant as the restaurant don’t use our panda delivery we are not responsible for it. I did highlight the fact that I ordered based on foodpanda and not based on restaurant so I expect some responsibility from panda side. Still they did not bother to address the issue . Intermediaries like food panda , deliveroo , honest bee should know that they share responsibility as they are the face of the company and their bread is from  margin on the food that restaurant sell for customers like me I can decide not to go to that particular restaurant if their service is bad but since my experience was worst with foodpanda I decided not to use that app ever. I don’t recommend them to any one as they don’t bother about their customers and wash off  their hands in cases where there are issues.

I told the agent about the tracking function and the agent advised there was a system glitch.  

At 12.30pm, the agent explained the rider had accidentally confirmed the order.  The agent had told the rider to expedite my order.  My kids are young and waiting for the food to arrive, hence I asked the agent for the arrival time.  The agent only replied they would expedite.  

It was already 12.45pm and I had enough of waiting and wanted to cancel the order.  The agent replied the rider met with an accident hence the delay.  I repeated that I want to cancel the order and the agent said the food were spilled when the rider met the accident. They would reprocess my order.  I told the agent please do not curse the rider and demanded refund (as it was already charged to my credit card).

I contacted the CS again and another agent replied how can she assist me?  I asked about my refund and she said it would be processed within 1-2 working days.  I asked for the email and she said would be sent by Finance.

And I know this is really hard to believe, but there are times when they get tired of eating...gasp...pizzas! Since I work Long hours and my helper does Long hours too (on her phone and makeup), I had no choice but to scramble for takeout or send them alone to the nearby food court, both not very feasible options. And  I live in the suburbs and my place is so far from town that it feels like you can get to JB faster than my house! So all in all, I felt that I had no option and I had given up on ever coming home to piping hot, scrumptious food from the restaurant of my choice, waiting for me on the dining table and to see my kids happily enjoying their dinner, licking their fingers and plate clean :(
No hope of that happening...that is, till foodpanda came along!

When I saw the glossy flyer in my mailbox, with the picture of a cute panda proudly proclaiming that they now deliver to my area...I can't even begin to describe what I felt! It felt like my life had changed...I suddenly felt so free and excited and started looking forward to ordering from a new restaurant Everyday. I downloaded the amazing foodpanda app and felt the Color return to my drab and boring life with every scroll of the page, showcasing menus after menus. I would like to go on record and say that my life has changed, completely, After I downloaded and started using the amazing foodpanda app. I sleep peacefully now, dream of pandas delivering yummy and exciting food Everyday. My kids are happy as they get to try new food Everyday. My helper is even happier now that she has even more time to try new hairstyles and to chat on the phone and surf the Internet. I am happy now that I don't have to run around packing food, I can just order with one touch of the button and sit back and relax and spend my time writing reviews like these. Thank you foodpanda!
